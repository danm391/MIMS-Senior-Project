Project Description

Project Name: Missing In Michigan System Software (MIMS)

The MIMS software is designed to minimize the gap of information regarding a missing person and to coordinate that information in a central tool. 
The goal is to circulate information between the parents, law enforcement, and the concerned public. The goals include the following:

- Allow parents to create a report on a missing person and make the information available for the public to view.
- Allow parents to coordinate missing person report with law enforcement. 
- Allow members of the concerned public to report information on a missing person based on suspicious activity or reported sightings.
- Allow law enforcement to receive updated notification on reported activity. 
	
The MIMS is a tool to push public awareness of missing people in the state of Michigan and give parents the assurance of taking action in controlling the 
awareness of their missing child.
